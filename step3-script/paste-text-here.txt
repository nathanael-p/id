This will be my tagline: Building the framework of the page.

This will be my introductory text, a paragraph(s) totalling at least 150 words that welcome user, state the goal of the portfolio website, and describe my ambitions and something positive I feel about working in web:Hello my name is Nathanael Pifer I am a web developer and this is my Portfolio.  I graduated from Pittsburgh Technical College with an Associate in Science Degree in Multimedia Technologies with a Concentration in Web Design and Development. I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive, fluid and intuitive websites. Growing up on a dairy farm taught me about hard work and getting the job done on time. I love sitting down and coding pages for hours on end and trying to solve the problem that each project brings. As a developer I build the framework of the page and make it function as intended in a nice modern fashion that will be pleasing and easy for anyone to use. Below are some examples of my previous work that I did in college on my own. I also built the framework for other team projects like the Elevated Learning Consultants site.
